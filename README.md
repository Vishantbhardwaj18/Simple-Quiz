Simple Quiz Application in Python: Brief Explanation
The Simple Quiz Application is a console-based program that quizzes users with multiple-choice questions. Here’s a brief overview of how it works:

Structure:
The application consists of a list of questions, each with multiple-choice answers and a correct answer.

Functionality:
The run_quiz() function manages the quiz flow. It displays questions one by one, allowing the user to input their answers.

Question Handling:
Each question is presented along with its answer options. The user is prompted to select an answer (A, B, C, or D).
After the user inputs their answer, the application checks if it's correct and updates the score accordingly.

Score Tracking:
The score is tracked throughout the quiz. For each correct answer, the score increases by one.

Final Output:
Once all questions have been answered, the application displays the user’s final score, indicating how many questions were answered correctly out of the total.

Code Components
Data Structure: Questions are stored in a list of dictionaries, making it easy to manage questions and their respective answers.
User Input: The program uses input() to capture user responses.
Control Flow: It uses loops and conditional statements to navigate through the questions and determine correct answers.

Conclusion
This quiz application serves as a practical introduction to basic programming concepts in Python, including loops, conditionals, and data structures, making it a great project for beginners. You can expand the quiz by adding more questions or features as you learn more about Python.
